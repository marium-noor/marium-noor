Hi, I’m Marium.

I began my coding journey 2 years ago with Harvard’s CS50, and since then I’ve built multiple web projects and spent the last year working as a frontend engineer at a UK-based healthtech startup.

I’m now pursuing my Computer science degree at FAST NUCES while working on the full stack AI applications, and learning machine learning on the side to push my skills beyond webdev.
