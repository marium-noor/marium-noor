Hi, this is Marium.

I started my career as a frontend developer, building strong expertise in creating responsive, user-focused web applications using modern tools and frameworks.

Over time, I've grown into a full-stack developer, currently focusing on Python and machine learning with the goal of becoming an AI engineer. My frontend background gives me a strong edge in building AI-driven systems that are not only technically sound but also intuitive and usable.
