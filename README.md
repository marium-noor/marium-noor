Hi, I’m Marium.

I began my coding journey 2 years ago with Harvard’s CS50, and since then I’ve built multiple web projects and spent the last year working as a frontend engineer at a UK-based healthtech startup.

I’m now pursuing my Computer science degree at FAST NUCES while learning AI automation and machine learning to push my skills beyond web development.
